# Profile UI Android Assignment - ASRITH BEHALA

This project is an Android application developed as a submission for the assignment from Andaz Kumar. The primary objective was to create a Profile Activity and User Interface that closely resembles the provided design specifications .

## Assignment Overview
*   **Task:** Create a Profile Activity and UI.
*   **Design:** The UI should look similar to the provided image .
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   Complete Android application code hosted on GitHub.
    *   Screenshots of the implemented Profile Activity included in this README.

## Tech Stack
*   **Language:** [Kotlin/Java]
*   **UI:** XML for layouts
*   **IDE:** Android Studio
*   **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## Features Implemented
*   A dedicated `ProfileActivity` to display user profile information.
*   User Interface built with XML, designed to be visually similar to the given  mock-up.
*   Static display of all sections shown in the design, including:
    *   Profile header (image placeholder, name, member since)
    *   "CRED garage" promotional banner
    *   Credit score, lifetime cashback, and bank balance rows
    *   "YOUR REWARDS & BENEFITS" section (cashback balance, coins, win upto Rs 1000)
    *   "TRANSACTIONS & SUPPORT" section (all transactions)
*   Appropriate use of drawables for icons where needed.



## How to Build and Run
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
      https://github.com/asrith2208/Android_ProfileUI_InternshipTask.git
    ```
    
2.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    *   Launch Android Studio.
    *   Select "Open" or "Open an Existing Project".
    *   Navigate to the cloned repository folder on your local machine and select it.

3.  **Gradle Sync:**
    *   Allow Android Studio to perform a Gradle sync. This will download all necessary dependencies.

4.  **Run the App:**
    *   Select an Android Virtual Device (AVD) from the AVD Manager or connect a physical Android device (ensure USB Debugging is enabled).
    *   Click the "Run 'app'" button (the green play icon) in the Android Studio toolbar.
    *   The application should build, install, and launch, displaying the Profile Activity.

## Notes!

*   This project focuses primarily on UI/UX replication from a static design.
*   Functionality for buttons or navigation (like the edit icon, refresh, arrows, etc.) is purely visual unless specified otherwise or if I decided to add basic placeholders.
*   The data displayed is static and hardcoded in the layouts/strings as per the visual design.
